# Acknowledgements

Widgets created based on the [Magneton](https://github.com/megagonlabs/magneton) template.

# Getting Started

> Note: This template is not compatible with Jupyter Notebook v7. Specifically, requires `notebook<7` and `ipywidgets<8`

## First-Time Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone this repo with the following commands.

```sh
# Clone the repository from git
git clone git@github.com:rit-git/magneton-examples.git

# cd into cloned repo
cd magneton-examples
```

### 2 Install dependencies 

#### 2a. If you are using Conda (else skip to 2b)

First, install ``pyenv``:
```sh
brew update
brew install pyenv
```

Then install ``pipenv``:
```sh
pipenv --python=$(conda run which python) --site-packages
```

#### 2b. With pipenv already installed

Next, install dependencies with the following commands.

> Recommended: use `pipenv` to simplify managing python packages and virtual environments. Read more [here](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).

```sh
# Creates a virtual environment and installs idependencies
pipenv install --dev

# Install javascript dependencies
yarn install # or `npm install`
```

### 3. Build Packages (First Time)

Use the following command to build the package to `dist`.

> Note that we use yarn/npm to build, which ensures that the JavaScript/TypeScript files are bundled before the python module is built from the `src` folder

```sh
# Build package for deployment
yarn build # or `npm run build`
```

Run the following command to "install" your package. 

```sh
# Install your package locally
pipenv run pip install -e .
```

### 4. Launch Widgets

Finally, start up a Jupyter Notebook instance with the following command and follow the instructions in the terminal to start testing your module in a notebook.

```sh
# Start Jupyter Notebook
pipenv run jupyter notebook
```
